## Task 1: Compositional interpreter

As suggested by the [lecture notes](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2019/blob/master/lecturenotes/12-syntacticvsmeta.scala#L51), reimplement the Compositional interpreter as an internal visitor.

## Task 2: Church encodings

In the lecture on Church encodings, we have seen Church encodings in FAE of booleans, numerals and operations on them.  This exercise requires you to use them to accomplish some simple programming tasks.

1. We have seen how the exponent operation `exp` is defined in terms of `mult` and `one`.  Give a similar definition of `mult` in terms of `add` and `zero` (unlike the one presented in the lecture).
2. Study carefully how `multlist` works.  Then define a function called `sumlist` that sums all Church-numerals in a list.
3. Bonus: Define a function called `allzeros` that tests whether a list of Church numerals are all zeros.

Do not forget to test your definitions.

## Task 3: Garbage Collection

Review the lecture notes on [Garbage](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2019/blob/master/lecturenotes/10-bcfae.scala) [Collection](https://github.com/ps-tuebingen-courses/pl1-2019/blob/master/lecturenotes/11-gc.scala)
and answer the following questions:

1. What was the reason why garbage collectors were invented in the first place?
2. What does it mean for a garbage collector to be _safe_?
3. What is a _generational_ garbage collection algorithm and why is it useful?
4. What is _reference counting_ and what is its disadvantage?
